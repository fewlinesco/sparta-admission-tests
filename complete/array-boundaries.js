/*
Using names has been documented in even the oldest historical records. Examples
of surnames are documented in the 11th century by the barons in England. English
surnames began as a way of identifying a certain aspect of that individual, such
as by trade, father's name, location of birth, or physical features, and were
not necessarily inherited. By 1400 most English families had adopted the use of
hereditary surnames.
