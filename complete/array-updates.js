/*
Seasons have an enormous influence on vegetation and plant growth. Winter
typically has cold weather, little daylight, and limited plant growth. In
spring, plants sprout, tree leaves unfurl, and flowers blossom. Summer is the
warmest time of the year and has the most daylight, so plants grow quickly. In
autumn, temperatures drop, and many trees lose their leaves.
The seasons in the Northern Hemisphere are the opposite of those in the Southern
Hemisphere. This means that in Argentina and Australia, winter begins in June.
