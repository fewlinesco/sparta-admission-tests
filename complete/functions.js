Although we know that the "Hello World" was first introduced by Brian Kernighan
in his book A Tutorial Introduction to the Programming Language B, no one can
really explain why it became popular. One theory seems to be that computers
were now able to communicate to the world with words instead of numbers or
flashing lights.

What we can say for sure is that it is now often the first example of any
programming language.
