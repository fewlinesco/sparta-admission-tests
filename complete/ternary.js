/*
Louis Armstrong was born and raised in New Orleans. Coming to prominence in the
1920s as an inventive trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational
influence in jazz. He changed the focus of the music from collective
improvisation to solo performance. With his instantly recognizable rich,
gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer and skillful
improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song.
