/*
Although there were no official capitalization rules in the English language
until the early 18th century, scribes had traditionally written certain
letters, such as nouns and the first letters of sentences, in a larger,
distinct script for hundreds of years.
The distinction between majuscule and miniscule letters doesn't exist in all
languages, though. Certain Eastern and Asian writing systems, including
Indian, Chinese, and Japanese alphabets, do not distinguish between them.
