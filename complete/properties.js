/*
The Peloponnesian War was an ancient Greek war fought between Athens and Sparta
and their respective allies for the hegemony of the Greek world. The war
remained undecided for a long time until the decisive intervention of the
Persian Empire in support of Sparta. Led by Lysander, the Spartan fleet
built with Persian subsidies finally defeated Athens and started a period of
Spartan domination over Greece.
