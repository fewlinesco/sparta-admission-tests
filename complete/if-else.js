/*
Passport is the main method to allow you entrance into a country. Border Patrol
will check that the passport you're using is not a fake one and from a country
that is allowed entry. The simplest way to be sure that you are from a country
that is allowed access is to have a passport from the same country.
Which is to say: if you want to enter Britain, the simplest way is to present a
British passport.
