/*
A lot of people feel sleepy during office hours, primarily because of the lack
of proper sleep during the night. Feeling lethargic and sleepy at your workplace
affects your performance too. So, it is important to sleep for about 7-8 hours
to maintain a healthy body and schedule for the next day. But even after
sleeping for recommended hours, if the problem persists, you are advised to
consult a doctor.
